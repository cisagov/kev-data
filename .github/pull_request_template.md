Please be familiar with this repo's [CONTRIBUTING](/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.

For suggesting a new KEV entry, please email [KEV@cisa.dhs.gov](mailto:KEV@cisa.dhs.gov), which is monitored directly by CISA employees responsible for validating new KEV entries. For more information on what qualifies for the KEV, see [BOD 22-01](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-22-01-reducing-significant-risk-known-exploited-vulnerabilities).

Also note: While we will make every effort to merge accepted PR cleanly to the data files (thus, preserving GitHub credit), there will be occasions where your change will be overwritten in a future update on CISA's backend, since this repository is ultimately a copy of the official data files hosted at https://www.cisa.gov. This repo's maintainers will make the determination, on a case-by-case basis, on how to best resolve PRs as they come up. That said, we very much appreciate your efforts to make the KEV data files more accurate!
